### INSTALLING VIRTUALBOX
VirtualBox is the software that runs the virtual machine. You can get it [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_1)
Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK.
You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it: Vagrant will do that.
